# BERT-Based Sentiment Analysis on Yelp Dataset

This project performs sentiment analysis on Yelp reviews using a fine-tuned BERT model. It involves preprocessing the dataset, training a transformer-based deep learning model to classify sentiment labels, and evaluating the model's performance. Additionally, a logistic regression baseline using TF-IDF features is implemented for comparison.

# Instructions

To run the project, convert the provided Python script (`bert_sentiment_analysis_yelp.py`) into a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) or run it directly as a Python script. Ensure all necessary dependencies such as `transformers`, `datasets`, `torch`, `scikit-learn`, and `nltk` are installed.

You can run the script using:

```bash
python bert_sentiment_analysis_yelp.py
